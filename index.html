  <h1>Rift Brawlers: Echoes of Power</h1>

  <div class="prompt">
    Across dimensions, a cosmic tournament has begun. Fighters from forgotten timelines, parallel Earths, and alternate realities have been summoned by a mysterious force known only as <strong>The Architect</strong>.<br><br>
    Each brawler wields not just strength—but the power of their reality. A knight made of code, a prehistoric shaman who controls extinction events, a rebel AI in a human body, and even a time-displaced janitor with paradox-based attacks.<br><br>
    The prize? Control of the <em>Prime Thread</em>—the one timeline that determines the fate of all others.<br><br>
    But be warned: the longer you fight, the more unstable your own timeline becomes. Choose your moves carefully. Each strike may change your past—or erase your future.
